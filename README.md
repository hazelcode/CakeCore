Please take care:
Please first select a language to apply to your minecraft world

cakecore esp language = Spanish (Espa√±ol)

cakecore eng language = English (English)

Please ***do not download code from main page***, only the [releases publised](https://github.com/tacozyt/CakeCore/releases) in the GitHub repository's releases page

We do not recommend download `Source Code` options, only `CakeCore` options, example: `CakeCore.v0.1.7.zip`

Move the language datapack to your world's datapacks folder
