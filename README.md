# Please be careful


Some scoreboards has incomplete names only for bugs (I can't write much long scoreboard names)
There are some scoreboards that have incomplete names, please check the list of mobs killed by a player on the [datapack wiki](https://github.com/tacozyt/CakeCore/wiki)


Please keep CakeCore updated in your datapack creation

CakeCore updates usually contains new functions and bug fixes (or content fixes)


You (How a datapacks creator/maker) need to specify the CakeCore version needed for your datapack, if you create a datapack with CakeCore v0.1.5 functions (for example), you need to specify: This datapack needs CakeCore v0.1.5 to work 100% functional. (for example).


If you update your datapack creation with a newer CakeCore version, please check the official CakeCore wiki [(CakeCore wiki)](https://github.com/tacozyt/CakeCore/wiki) and check all the contents and articles, update scoreboards, functions, etc, and apply/replace old features (Scoreboards, functions, etc) in your updated datapack creation.


I recommend apply the new features and prove the updated datapack creation in a test world (With the new CakeCore version), replace and rewrite wrong lines and spaces (and files of your datapack creation in a hard case).

When the datapack be functional with the new CakeCore version, please release the new datapack version specifying the new CakeCore version required to work 100% functional.


WARNING! Necessary: CakeCore maybe not loaded automatically.

Please add `"cake:load",` in the first line of the section `"values"` in your datapack's load.json file (`data\minecraft\tags\functions\load.json`).
